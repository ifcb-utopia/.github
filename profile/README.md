# User-friendly Tools for Oceanic Plankton Image Analysis (UTOPIA)

## About 
This is a project by researchers at the University of Washington (Seattle, USA). We aim to provide a community space for users of the Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) instrument to collaborate and share code and ideas for machine learning approaches to IFCB image classification.

Currently you can find several repos, described below, with code that may be useful for processing IFCB data and exploring the use of CNNs for IFCB image classifcation. Please note that we have ongoing development of these resources. 

## End-to-end workflow
We are working to improve and refine our end-to-end processing of IFCB data to go from raw to classified, specifically for broad taxonomic classification of open-ocean data. You can view the document with instructions for the latest version of the step-by-step workflow [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v78DhgiWB4M0M7qYaxqjW88OlVZ1Z9LHt92v0wSv8gg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Repositories
### ml-workflow
Train CNNs to classify IFCB images into broad taxonomic groups

### ifcb-tools
Forked from [OceanOptics/ifcb-tools](https://github.com/OceanOptics/ifcb-tools). Development of tools specific to the deployment of CNNs is taking place on the ml_dev branch.

### plankton-CNN-DEMO
A project by H. Bhatti that provides a demo of deep-learning based phytoplankton image classification.

### model-development-archive
Archived code for CNN model development and training for IFCB data written by E. Culhane during 2019-2020.
